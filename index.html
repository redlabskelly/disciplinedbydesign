                        <h2>College Consulting</h2>
                        <p> College is one of the biggest decisions of your life. Students require guidance for navigating the college application process, SAT/ACT studying, financial aid and scholarships; and that's all before selecting a college and degree program. </p>
  <p> Disciplined by Design helps students at all levels of high school to understand their needs in selecting a university, and figuring out the pieces they need to get accepted to their dream school. We offer goals and career assessments, including a complete Birkman assessment and consultation to develop a list of colleges that meet each student's needs. We can also provide test prep support, application and financial aid assistance, and interview and resume help.  </p>

                        <h2>Team Building</h2>
                        <p> Even when we are aware of our own needs, it can often be difficult to understand the needs of others. When we work in teams, communication is essential, and it can break down quickly and easily. Taking the time to understand the people on your team, and the best strategies to effectively work together can save valuable time and energy. It can take years to understand your employees or your bosses needs. Or with Disciplined by Design, it can take a few hours.  </p>
                          <p> Additionally, we offer team building exercises and workshops that help create an environment that is conducive to your culture. </p>
